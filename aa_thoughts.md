 - 1st Hackathon is more setting up a base on which to build, not making something ultra super amazing
 - Design of massinve MNR mesh
 - Canned config for the VPN (must all have same VPN name due to MNR)
 - Use of SEMPv2 to configure?  I could ask Mark for help to translate... but that's all pre/prep work, so not as important?  Or make stretch goal for participants?
 - Provide JavaScript sample for lat/lon publisher - based on existing TopicPublisher GitHub sample
 - Provide JavaScript Solace+Google Maps sample for subscribing to all lat/lon topics, and rendering on map
 - Leave these very simple... it allows people to take and run with ideas, build something extra, port to new language, etc.
 - Each VMR should have a standard read-only CLI account, that we can run the StatsPump against (eventually).  E.g. "stats_ro" or something
 - Each VMR hostname should have a 3 letter prefix from either the regions it's from, or nearest hub city (e.g. hkg_aaron_sol1)
